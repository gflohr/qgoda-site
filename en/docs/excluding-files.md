description: How to exclude (or include) additional paths in Qgoda.
---
By default, Qgoda does not process hidden files and directories (name starts with a dot `.`).  Top-level files and directories that have names beginning with an underscore `_` are also excluded.

<!--qgoda-no-xgettext-->
[% USE q = Qgoda %]
<qgoda-toc />
<!--/qgoda-no-xgettext-->

## Excluding Additional Files

You can change this default behavior by configuring additional file name patterns in the variable `C:exclude` in the configuration file `P:_qgoda.yml`.

Example:

<!--qgoda-no-xgettext-->
```yaml
exclude:
- /node_modules
- /package.json
- /webpack.config.js
- assets/images/**/*.xcf
```
<!--/qgoda-no-xgettext-->

This will also exclude the top-level directory `node_modules`, and the top-level files `package.json` and `webpack.config.js`.  Likewise, all XCF files (the image format of [The Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/) in the directory `assets/images` and all of its descendant directories are excluded.

Please see [% q.lanchor(name = 'pattern-lists') %] for the gory details of search patterns and lists of search patterns in Qgoda.

## Automatically Excluded Files

Internally, Qgoda does not use the configured exclusion list directly but a slightly extended one.  For the above example it looks like this:

<!--qgoda-no-xgettext-->
```yaml
exclude:
- .*
- /_*
- /node_modules
- /package.json
- /webpack.config.js
- assets/images/**/*.xcf
- /_site
```
<!--/qgoda-no-xgettext-->

The first two lines exclude files and directories that have names beginning with a dot (`.`) or top-level files and directories that have names beginning with an underscore.

The last line is always appended and a safe-guard against configuration errors.  Unintentionally including the output directory `P:_site` would lead to an infinite recursion.  The output directory is therefore always added to the exclusion list.

## Including Files

There is no configuration variable `include`.  You can exclude otherwise excluded files by prepending a pattern with an exclamation mark `!`.  The pattern is then negated:

<!--qgoda-no-xgettext-->
```yaml
exclude:
- /node_modules
- /package.json
- /webpack.config.js
- assets/images/**/*.xcf
- "!/_posts"
```
<!--/qgoda-no-xgettext-->

This would now enable processing of all the files in the top-level directory `_posts`.

Beware though that you cannot re-include files or directories, when one of their parent directories is already excluded.

Example:

<!--qgoda-no-xgettext-->
```yaml
exclude:
- /archive
- "!/archive/2017"
```
<!--/qgoda-no-xgettext-->

The second pattern is invalid and ignored because `/archive` is a parent directory of `/archive/2017`.

This behavior has performance reasons.  When Qgoda collects files, it does not descend into excluded directories.  In the above example, it would not read the contents of `archive` and would therefore never see the subdirectory `archive/2017`.

That leads to a little problem if you want to re-include a subdirectory of an automatically excluded directory, for example `_experiments/stable`.  The top-level directory `_experiments` is automatically excluded by Qgoda.  In order to re-include it, you would have to do the following:

<!--qgoda-no-xgettext-->
```yaml
exclude:
- "!/_experiments"
- /_experiments/*
- "!/_experiments/stable"
```
<!--/qgoda-no-xgettext-->

You have to keep in mind that Qgoda has prepended this list with `/_*` (see above).  Line 1 re-includes `_experiments`.  Line 2 excludes all its subdirectories again.  And line 3 selectively re-includes `_experiments/stable`.

## Excluding Files From Being Watched

There is another configuration variable `C:exclude-watch` that specifies files and directories that should not be watched.  If you omit that variable, the contents of `C:exclude` is taken instead.

Note that Qgoda by default re-includes the directory `P:_views`.

Example:

<!--qgoda-no-xgettext-->
```yaml
exclude-watch:
- assets/movies
```
<!--/qgoda-no-xgettext-->

The list that is really used by Qgoda looks like this:

<!--qgoda-no-xgettext-->
```yaml
exclude-watch:
- .*
- /_*
- "!/_views"
- assets/movies
- /_site
```
<!--/qgoda-no-xgettext-->

You can see that the directory `_views` has been re-included because it contains layout and design files.
