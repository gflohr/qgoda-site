[% USE q = Qgoda %]
<!--/qgoda-no-xgettext-->

A typical Qgoda site contains a couple of standard files and directories.
They are described in the following list.

[% WRAPPER components/infobox.html
           type='info' title='Sorting of This List' %]
The list is sorted alphanumerically but case-insensitive, and a leading
underscore of the name is ignored.
[% END %]

[% WRAPPER components/file.html
   name="_assets" type='directory' -%]
This directory usually keeps the source files for assets, for example
JavaScript files or (S)CSS files.  Qgoda does not use this name internally.  It is just a convention.
[%- END %]

[% WRAPPER components/file.html
   name="_config.yaml" type='file' -%]
Qgoda's main configuration file.
[%- END %]

[% WRAPPER components/file.html
   name="_config.yml" type='file' -%]
Qgoda's secondary configuration file.  It is only used if <code>P:config.yaml</code>
does not exist.
[%- END %]

[% WRAPPER components/file.html
   name="_includes" type='directory'
   overridable="paths.includes" -%]
Directory for included content snippets.  You use that for example
like <code>[&#37; q.include("_includes/footer.md") &#37;]</code>.  Using the
name `_includes` is not enforced by Qgoda.  But you should use a name that starts with an underscore (so that the files are not misinterpreted as regular content) and add the negated name to the configuration variable `C:exclude-watch`.
[%- END %]

[% WRAPPER components/file.html
   name="_plugins" type='directory'
   overridable="paths.plugins" -%]
Directory for site-specific plug-ins.  Plug-Ins in this directory are
automatically activated.
[%- END %]

[% WRAPPER components/file.html
   name="_site" type='directory'
   overridable="paths.site" -%]
The output directory.  This will normally be the document root of your
web server.  Files and directories in <code>P:_site</code> are 
overwritten without warning.
[%- END %]

[% WRAPPER components/file.html
   name="_timestamp" type='file'
   overridable="paths.timestamp" -%]

This file contains the time, when <code>P:_site</code> was last
re-created as seconds since the <q-term>epoch</q-term>.  If you 
automatically re-load pages in the browser, for example with
<a href="https://www.browsersync.io/")>browser-sync</a>, you should 
specify  <code>P:_timestamp</code> as the file to watch for changes.
