In the survey ["9 Best Free and Open Source Perl Static Site Generators"](https://www.linuxlinks.com/best-free-open-source-perl-static-site-generators/) by Eilidih Parris published
on [LinuxLinks](https://www.linuxlinks.com/), Qgoda came in on first place with
a rating of 7.9 out of 10 points. Runner-up is [Plerd](https://github.com/jmacdotorg/plerd),
followed by [Statocles](http://preaction.me/statocles/) and
[ikiwiki](https://ikiwiki.info/) on joint 3rd place.

The advantages of static site generators mentioned in the survey are:

* speed
* security
* obsolescence/less software
* hosting cost
* staging/previews
* better exportability and indexability
* versioning

LinuxLinks has also created a [portal page for
Qgoda](https://www.linuxlinks.com/qgoda-extensible-static-site-generator/).
Thanks for the positive feedback!
